2482	When do juvenile develop into adults?	In some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents and attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis, after dropping to the sea-floor.	entailment

On the other hand, in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish.	not_entailment
2494	How does cooling of the local environment affect the mnemiopsis?	Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism.	entailment
2495	How does cooling of the local environment affect the mnemiopsis?	The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores.	not_entailment

5710	What can be seen between hadrons?	However, a residual of the force is observed between hadrons (the best known example being the force that acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei) as the nuclear force.	entailment
5711	What can be seen between hadrons?	The failure of many searches for free quarks has shown that the elementary particles affected are not directly observable.	not_entailment
5712	What is the term for the lack of obsevable free quarks?	This phenomenon is called color confinement.	entailment
5713	What is the term for the lack of obsevable free quarks?	The failure of many searches for free quarks has shown that the elementary particles affected are not directly observable.	not_entailment
5714	What is the observable effect of W and Z boson exchange?	Its most familiar effect is beta decay (of neutrons in atomic nuclei) and the associated radioactivity.	entailment
5715	What is the observable effect of W and Z boson exchange?	The weak force is due to the exchange of the heavy W and Z bosons.	not_entailment
5716	What occurs when electron clouds overlap from different atoms?	When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects.:93 The normal force, for example, is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object.	entailment
5717	What occurs when electron clouds overlap from different atoms?	The normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact.	not_entailment
5718	What causes Pauli repulsion?	When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects.:93 The normal force, for example, is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object.	entailment
5719	What causes Pauli repulsion?	The normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact.	not_entailment
5720	In what way do idea strings transmit tesion forces?	Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object.	entailment
5721	In what way do idea strings transmit tesion forces?	However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load.	not_entailment
5722	What does matter actually have that Newtonian mechanics doesn't address?	However, in real life, matter has extended structure and forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object.	entailment
5723	What does matter actually have that Newtonian mechanics doesn't address?	Newton's laws and Newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three-dimensional objects.	not_entailment
5724	Where does centripetal force go?	This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path.	entailment
5725	Where does centripetal force go?	This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.	not_entailment
5726	What is resposible for speeding up or slowing down an object?	This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.	entailment
5727	What is resposible for speeding up or slowing down an object?	The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path.	not_entailment
5728	What is the law of thermodynamics associated with closed system heat exchange?	According to the Second law of thermodynamics, nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases.	entailment
5729	What is the law of thermodynamics associated with closed system heat exchange?	In macroscopic closed systems, nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system, and are often associated with the transfer of heat.	not_entailment
5730	What is the kilogram-force sometimes reffered to as?	The pound-force has a metric counterpart, less commonly used than the newton: the kilogram-force (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass.	entailment
5731	What is the kilogram-force sometimes reffered to as?	The kilogram-force leads to an alternate, but rarely used unit of mass: the metric slug (sometimes mug or hyl) is that mass that accelerates at 1 m·s−2 when subjected to a force of 1 kgf.	not_entailment
